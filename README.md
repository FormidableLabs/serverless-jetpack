## Overview

The Serverless framework is a **fantastic** one-stop-shop for taking your code and packing up all the infrastructure around it to deploy it to the cloud. Unfortunately, for many JavaScript applications, some aspects of packaging are slow, hindering deployment speed and developer happiness.

With the `serverless-jetpack` plugin, many common, slow Serverless packaging scenarios can be dramatically sped up. All with a very easy, seamless integration into your existing Serverless projects.

## Usage

### The short, short version

First, install the plugin:

```sh
$ yarn add --dev serverless-jetpack
$ npm install --save-dev serverless-jetpack
```

Add to `serverless.yml`

```yml
plugins:
  - serverless-jetpack
```

... and you're off to faster packaging awesomeness! üöÄ

### A little more detail...

The plugin supports all normal built-in Serverless framework packaging configurations in `serverless.yml` like:

```yml
package:
  # Any `include`, `exclude` logic is applied to the whole service, the same
  # as built-in serverless packaging.
  # include: ...
  exclude:
    - "*"
    - "**/node_modules/aws-sdk/**" # included on Lambda.
    - "!package.json"

plugins:
  # Add the plugin here.
  - serverless-jetpack

functions:
  base:
    # ...
  another:
    # ...
    package:
      # These work just like built-in serverless packaging - added to the
      # service-level exclude/include fields.
      include:
        - "src/**"
        - "!**/node_modules/aws-sdk/**" # Faster way to exclude
        - "package.json"
```

### Configuration

Most Serverless framework projects should be able to use Jetpack without any extra configuration besides the `plugins` entry. However, there are some additional options that may be useful in some projects (e.g., [lerna][] monorepos, [yarn workspaces][])...

**Service**-level configurations available via `custom.jetpack`:

* `base` (`string`): The base directory (relative to `servicePath` / CWD) at which dependencies may be discovered by Jetpack. This is useful in some bespoke monorepo scenarios where dependencies may be hoisted/flattened to a root `node_modules` directory that is the parent of the directory `serverless` is run from. (default: Serverless' `servicePath` / CWD).
    * _WARNING_: If you don't **know** that you need this option, you probably don't want to set it. Setting the base dependency root outside of Serverless' `servicePath` / current working directory (e.g., `..`) may have some unintended side effects. Most notably, any discovered `node_modules` dependencies will be flattened into the zip at the same level as `servicePath` / CWD. E.g., if dependencies were included by Jetpack at `node_modules/foo` and then `../node_modules/foo` they would be collapsed in the resulting zip file package.
    * **Layers**: Layers are a bit of an odddity with built-in Serverless Framework packaging in that the current working directory is `layer.NAME.path` (and not `servicePath` like usual), yet things like `include|exclude` apply relatively to the layer `path`, not the `servicePath`. Jetpack has a similar choice and applies `base` applies to the root `servicePath` for everything (layers, functions, and service packaging), which seems to be the best approach given that monorepo consumers may well lay out projects like `functions/*` and `layers/*` and need dependency inference to get all the way to the root irrespective of a child layer `path`.
* `roots` (`Array<string>`): A list of paths (relative to `servicePath` / CWD) at which there may additionally declared and/or installed `node_modules`. (default: [Serverless' `servicePath` / CWD]).
    * Setting a value here replaces the default `[servicePath]` with the new array, so if you want to additionally keep the `servicePath` in the roots array, set as: `[".", ADDITION_01, ADDITION_02, ...]`.
    * This typically occurs in a monorepo project, wherein dependencies may be located in e.g. `packages/{NAME}/node_modules` and/or hoisted to the `node_modules` at the project base. It is important to specify these additional dependency roots so that Jetpack can (1) find and include the right dependencies and (2) hone down these directories to just production dependencies when packaging. Otherwise, you risk having a slow `serverless package` execution and/or end up with additional/missing dependencies in your final application zip bundle.
    * You only need to declare roots of things that _aren't_ naturally inferred in a dependency traversal. E.g., if starting at `packages/{NAME}/package.json` causes a traversal down to `node_modules/something` then symlinked up to `lib/something-else/node_modules/even-more` these additional paths don't need to be separately declared because they're just part of the dependency traversal.
    * **Layers**: Similar to `base`, both the project/service- and layer-level `roots` declarations will be relative to the project `servicePath` directory and _not_ the `layers.NAME.path` directory.
* `preInclude` (`Array<string>`): A list of glob patterns to be added _before_ Jetpack's dependency pattern inclusion and Serverless' built-in service-level and then function-level `package.include`s. This option most typically comes up in a monorepo scenario where you want a broad base exclusion like `!functions/**` or `!packages/**` at the service level and then inclusions in later functions.
* `concurrency` (`Number`): The number of independent package tasks (per function and service) to run off the main execution thread. If `1`, then run tasks serially in main thread. If `2+` run off main thread with `concurrency` number of workers. (default: `1`).
    * This option is most useful for Serverless projects that (1) have many individually packaged functions, and (2) large numbers of files and dependencies. E.g., start considering this option if your per-function packaging time takes more than 10 seconds and you have more than one service and/or function package.

The following **function** and **layer**-level configurations available via `functions.{FN_NAME}.jetpack` and  `layers.{LAYER_NAME}.jetpack`:

* `roots` (`Array<string>`): This option **adds** more dependency roots to the service-level `roots` option.
* `preInclude` (`Array<string>`): This option **adds** more glob patterns to the service-level `preInclude` option.

Here are some example configurations:

**Additional roots**

```yml
# serverless.yml
plugins:
  - serverless-jetpack

functions:
  base:
    # ...
  another:
    # This example monorepo project has:
    # - `packages/another/src`: JS source code to include
    # - `packages/another/package.json`: Declares production dependencies
    # - `packages/another/node_modules`: One location prod deps may be.
    # - `node_modules`: Another location prod deps may be if hoisted.
    # ...
    package:
      individually: true
    jetpack:
      roots:
        # If you want to keep prod deps from servicePath/CWD package.json
        # - "."
        # Different root to infer prod deps from package.json
        - "packages/another"
    include:
      # Ex: Typically you'll also add in sources from a monorepo package.
      - "packages/another/src/**"
```

**Different base root**

```yml
# serverless.yml
plugins:
  - serverless-jetpack

custom:
  jetpack:
    # Search for hoisted dependencies to one parent above normal.
    base: ".."

package:
  # ...
  include:
    # **NOTE**: The include patterns now change to allow the underlying
    # globbing libraries to reach below the working directory to our base,
    # so patterns should be of the format:
    # - "!{BASE/,}{**/,}NORMAL_PATTERN"
    # - "!{BASE/,}{**/,}node_modules/aws-sdk/**"
    # - "!{BASE/,}{**/,}node_modules/{@*/*,*}/README.md"
    #
    # ... here with a BASE of `..` that means:
    # General
    - "!{../,}{**/,}.DS_Store"
    - "!{../,}{**/,}.vscode/**"
    # Dependencies
    - "!{../,}{**/,}node_modules/aws-sdk/**"
    - "!{../,}{**/,}node_modules/{@*/*,*}/CHANGELOG.md"
    - "!{../,}{**/,}node_modules/{@*/*,*}/README.md"

functions:
  base:
    # ...
```

**With custom pre-includes**

```yml
# 1. `preInclude` comes first after internal `**` pattern.
custom:
  jetpack:
    preInclude:
      - "!**" # Start with absolutely nothing (typical in monorepo scenario)

# 2. Jetpack then dynamically adds in production dependency glob patterns.

# 3. Then, we apply the normal serverless `include`s.
package:
  individually: true
  include:
    - "!**/node_modules/aws-sdk/**"

plugins:
  - serverless-jetpack

functions:
  base:
    # ...
  another:
    jetpack:
      roots:
        - "packages/another"
      preInclude:
        # Tip: Could then have a service-level `include` negate subfiles.
        - "packages/another/dist/**"
    include:
      - "packages/another/src/**"
```

**Layers**

```yml
# serverless.yml
plugins:
  - serverless-jetpack

layers:
  vendor:
    # A typical pattern is `NAME/nodejs/node_modules` that expands to
    # `/opt/nodejs/node_modules` which is included in `NODE_PATH` and available
    # to running lambdas. Here, we use `jetpack.roots` to properly exclude
    # `devDependencies` that built-in Serverless wouldn't.
    path: layers/vendor
    jetpack:
      roots:
        # Instruct Jetpack to review and exclude devDependencies originating
        # from this `package.json` directory.
        - "layers/vendor/nodejs"
```

## Command Line Interface

Jetpack also provides some CLI options.

### `serverless jetpack package`

Package a function like `serverless package` does, just with better options.

```sh
$ serverless jetpack package -h
Plugin: Jetpack
jetpack package ............... Packages a Serverless service or function
    --function / -f .................... Function name. Packages a single function (see 'deploy function')
```

So, to package all service / functions like `serverless package` does, use:

```sh
$ serverless jetpack package # OR
$ serverless package
```

... as this is basically the same built-in or custom.

The neat addition that Jetpack provides is:

```sh
$ serverless jetpack package -f|--function {NAME}
```

which allows you to package just one named function exactly the same as `serverless deploy -f {NAME}` does. (Curiously `serverless deploy` implements the `-f {NAME}` option but `serverless package` does not.)

## How it works

Serverless built-in packaging slows to a crawl in applications that have lots of files from `devDependencies`. Although the `excludeDevDependencies` option will ultimately remove these from the target zip bundle, it does so only **after** the files are read from disk, wasting a lot of disk I/O and time.

The `serverless-jetpack` plugin removes this bottleneck by performing a fast production dependency on-disk discovery via the [inspectdep][] library before any globbing is done. The discovered production dependencies are then converted into patterns and injected into the otherwise normal Serverless framework packaging heuristics to efficiently avoid all unnecessary disk I/O due to `devDependencies` in `node_modules`.

Process-wise, the `serverless-jetpack` plugin detects when built-in packaging applies and then takes over the packaging process. The plugin then sets appropriate internal Serverless `artifact` fields to cause Serverless to skip the (slower) built-in packaging.

### The nitty gritty of why it's faster

Let's start by looking at how Serverless packages (more or less):

1. If the `excludeDevDependencies` option is set, use synchronous `globby()` for on disk I/O calls to find all the `package.json` files in `node_modules`, then infer which are `devDependencies`. Use this information to enhance the `include|exclude` configured options.
2. Glob files from disk using [globby][] with a root `**` (all files) and the `include` pattern, following symlinks, and create a list of files (no directories). This is again disk I/O.
3. Filter the in-memory list of files using [nanomatch][] via service + function `exclude`, then `include` patterns in order to decide what is included in the package zip file.

This is potentially slow if `node_modules` contains a lot of ultimately removed files, yielding a lot of completely wasted disk I/O time.

Jetpack, by contrast does the following:

1. Efficiently infer production dependencies from disk without globbing, and without reading any `devDependencies`.
2. Glob files from disk with a root `**` (all files), `!node_modules/**` (exclude all by default), `node_modules/PROD_DEP_01/**, node_modules/PROD_DEP_02/**, ...` (add in specific directories of production dependencies), and then the normal `include` patterns. This small nuance of limiting the `node_modules` globbing to **just** production dependencies gives us an impressive speedup.
3. Apply service + function `exclude`, then `include` patterns in order to decide what is included in the package zip file.

This ends up being way faster in most cases, and particularly when you have very large `devDependencies`. It is worth pointing out the minor implication that:

* If your `include|exclude` logic intends to glob in `devDependencies`, this won't work anymore. But, you're not really planning on deploying non-production dependencies are you? üòâ

### Complexities

#### Minor differences vs. Serverless globbing

Our [benchmark correctness tests](./test/benchmark.js) highlight a number of various files not included by Jetpack that are included by `serverless` in packaging our benchmark scenarios. Some of these are things like `node_modules/.yarn-integrity` which Jetpack knowingly ignores because you shouldn't need it. All of the others we've discovered to date are instances in which `serverless` incorrectly includes `devDependencies`...

#### Layers

Jetpack supports `layer` packaging as close to `serverless` as it can. However, there are a couple of very wonky things with `serverless`' approach that you probably want to keep in mind:

* Service level `package.include|exclude` patterns are applied at the `layers.NAME.path` level for a given layer. So, e.g., if you have a service-level `include` pattern of `"!*"` to remove `ROOT/foo.txt`, this will apply at a **different** root path from `layers.NAME.path` of like `ROOT/layers/NAME/foo.txt`.
* As mentioned in our options configuration section above, Jetpack applies the `base` and `roots` options to the root project `servicePath` for dependency searching and not relatively to layer `path`s.

#### Be careful with `include` configurations and `node_modules`

Let's start with how `include|exclude` work for both Serverless built-in packaging and Jetpack:

1. **Disk read phase** with `globby()`. Assemble patterns in order from below and then return a list of files matching the total patterns.

    1. Start at `**` (everything).
    2. (_Jetpack only_) Add in service and function-level `jetpack.preInclude` patterns.
    3. (_Jetpack only_) Add in dynamic patterns to `include` production `node_modules`.
    4. Add in service and function-level `package.include` patterns.

2. **File filtering phase** with `nanomatch()`. Once we have a list of files read from disk, we apply patterns in order as follows to decide whether to include them (last postitive match wins).

    1. (_Jetpack only_) Add in service and function-level `jetpack.preInclude` patterns.
    2. (_Jetpack only_) Add in dynamic patterns to `include` production `node_modules`.
    3. Add in service and function-level `package.exclude` patterns.
    4. (_Serverless only_) Add in dynamic patterns to `exclude` development `node_modules`
    5. Add in service and function-level `package.include` patterns.

The practical takeaway here is the it is typically faster to prefer `include` exclusions like `!foo/**` than to use `exclude` patterns like `foo/**` because the former avoids a lot of unneeded disk I/O.

Let's consider a pattern like this:

```yml
include:
  - "node_modules/**"
exclude:
  - # ... a whole bunch of stuff ...
```

This would likely be just as slow as built-in Serverless packaging because all of `node_modules` gets read from disk.

Thus, the **best practice** here when crafting service or function `include` configurations is: **don't `include` anything extra in `node_modules`**. It's fine to do extra exclusions like:

```yml
# Good. Remove dependency provided by lambda from zip
exclude:
  - "**/node_modules/aws-sdk/**"

# Better! Never even read the files from disk during globbing in the first place!
include:
  - "!**/node_modules/aws-sdk/**"
```

## Benchmarks

The following is a simple, "on my machine" benchmark generated with `yarn benchmark`. It should not be taken to imply any real world timings, but more to express relative differences in speed using the `serverless-jetpack` versus the built-in baseline Serverless framework packaging logic.

As a quick guide to the results table:

- `Scenario`: Contrived scenarios for the purpose of generating results.
    - `simple`: Very small production and development dependencies.
    - `individually`: Same dependencies as `simple`, but with `individually` packaging.
    - `huge`: Lots and lots of development dependencies.
- `Mode`: Project installed via `yarn` or `npm`? This really only matters in that `npm` and `yarn` may flatten dependencies differently, so we want to make sure Jetpack is correct in both cases.
- `Type`: `jetpack` is this plugin and `baseline` is Serverless built-in packaging.
- `Time`: Elapsed build time in milliseconds.
- `vs Base`: Percentage difference of `serverless-jetpack` vs. Serverless built-in. Negative values are faster, positive values are slower.

* os:   `darwin 18.5.0 x64`
* node: `v8.16.0`
