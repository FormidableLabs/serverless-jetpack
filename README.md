Serverless Jetpack
==================

A faster JavaScript packager for [Serverless][] applications.

## Overview

The Serverless framework is a **fantastic** one-stop-shop for taking your code and packing up all the infrastructure around it to deploy it to the cloud. Unfortunately, for many JavaScript applications, some aspects of packaging are slow, hindering development speed and happiness.

With the `serverless-jetpack` plugin, many common, slow Serverless packaging scenarios can be dramatically sped up. All with a very easy, seamless integration into your existing Serverless projects.

## How it works

The Serverless framework can sometimes massively slow down when packaging applications with large amounts / disk ussage for `devDependencies`. Although the framework enables `excludeDevDependencies` during packaging by default, just ingesting all the files that are later excluded (via that setting and normal `include|exclude` globs) causes apparently enough disk I/O to make things potentially slow.

Observing that a very common use case for a Serverless framework is:

- A `package.json` file defining production and development dependencies.
- A `yarn.lock` file if using `yarn` or a `package-lock.json` file if using `npm` to lock down and speed up installations.
- One or more JavaScript source file directories, typically something like `src`.

The `serverless-jetpack` plugin leverages this use case and gains a potentially significant speedup by observing that manually pruning development dependencies (as Serverless does) can be much, much slower in practice than using honed, battle-tested tools like `yarn` and `npm` to install just the production dependencies from scratch -- by doing a fresh `yarn|npm install` in a temporary directory, copying over source files and zipping that all up!

Process-wise, the `serverless-jetpack` plugin uses the internal logic from Serverless packaging to detect when Serverless would actually do it's own packaging. Then, it inserts its different packaging steps and copies over the analogous zip file to where Serverless would have put it, and sets internal Serverless `artifact` field that then causes Serverless to skip all its normal packaging steps.
